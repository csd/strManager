1. USAGE
========

Broadcast strManager example. One sources (source) with their own IP addresses
(IP1) send their media flow to MCU. The MCU listen it in port1. Three destinations
with their own IP addresses (IP2, IP3 and IP4) receive the flow on their own ports
(port2, port3 and port4).

BC_strManager [source IP1] [MCU port1]
              [destination2 IP2] [destination port2]
              [destination3 IP3] [destination port3]
              [destination4 IP4] [destination port4]
