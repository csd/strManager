1. USAGE
========

Zapping strManager example. Three sources (source1, source2 and source3) with
their own IP addresses (IP1, IP2 and IP3) send their media flows to MCU. The MCU
listen each one in a different port (port1, port2 and port3). Destination with
their IP address receives one flow each time on port4 and can switch it by 
pressing enter.

ZAP_strManager [source1 IP1] [MCU port1] [source2 IP2] [MCU port2]
               [source3 IP3] [MCU port3] [destination IP4] [destination port4]
